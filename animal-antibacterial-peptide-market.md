<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Animal Antibacterial Peptide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anionic Peptides</li><li>Cationic Peptide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Animal antibacterial peptides can be classified into anionic peptides and cationic peptides. Anionic peptides are negatively charged and work by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, leading to their death. Cationic peptides, on the other hand, are positively charged and can bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell wall, disrupting its structure and function. Both types of peptides have shown effectiveness in combating bacterial infections and have the potential to be used in various applications in the animal health market.</p></p>
