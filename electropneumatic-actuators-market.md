<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electropneumatic Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Actuator</li><li>Double Acting Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Acting Actuator: This type of actuator uses air pressure to move the piston in one direction only, either extending or retracting the actuator. It requires an external force, such as a spring or gravity, to return the piston to its original position. Single acting actuators are commonly used in applications where the actuator only needs to move in one direction.</p><p>Double Acting Actuator: In contrast, double acting actuators use air pressure to move the piston in both directions, allowing for more precise control of the actuator's movement. This type of actuator does not require an external force to return the piston to its original position. Double acting actuators are often used in applications where precise and controlled movement in both directions is needed.</p></p>
