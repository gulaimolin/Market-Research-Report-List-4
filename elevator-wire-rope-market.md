<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevator Wire Rope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fiber Core</li><li>Steel Core</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elevator wire ropes are essential components in the construction and operation of elevators. They come in two main types: fiber core and steel core. Fiber core ropes are lighter and more flexible, making them ideal for low- to medium-rise buildings. On the other hand, steel core ropes are stronger and more durable, making them suitable for high-rise buildings and heavy-duty applications. Both types of wire ropes play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of elevators in various buildings and structures.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Elevator Wire Rope Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traction Elevators</li><li>Hydraulic Elevators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elevator wire rope market serves traction elevators and hydraulic elevators, which are essential components in the vertical transportation industry. Traction elevators utilize wire ropes to move the elevator car by gripping onto the ropes and pulling them to move the car up and down. Hydraulic elevators, on the other hand, use wire ropes to support the elevator car and counterbalance the hydraulic system's movements. Both types of elevators rely on wire ropes for safe and efficient operation in various buildings and structures.</p></p>
