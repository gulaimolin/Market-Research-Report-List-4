<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gauge Pressure Transmitters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Line Gauge Pressure Transmitters</li><li>Remote-Sealed Gauge Pressure Transmitters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-Line Gauge Pressure Transmitters are directly mounted onto the process piping or vessel, allowing for easy installation and maintenance. They measure pressure within the pipeline or vessel and transmit this information to control systems. On the other hand, Remote-Sealed Gauge Pressure Transmitters have a separate diaphragm seal that isolates the sensing element from the process fluid, making them ideal for measuring pressure in corrosive or high-temperature environments. Both types are widely used in various industries for monitoring and controlling pressure levels.</p></p>
