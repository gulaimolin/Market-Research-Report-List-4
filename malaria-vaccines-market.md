<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Malaria Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Erythrocytic Vaccine</li><li>Erythrocytic Vaccine</li><li>Multi-antigen Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Malaria vaccines can be categorized into three main types based on the stage of the malaria parasite they target. Pre-Erythrocytic vaccines aim to prevent infection by targeting the parasite before it enters the liver. Erythrocytic vaccines focus on targeting the parasite once it is in the bloodstream. Multi-antigen vaccines combine multiple antigens to target different stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle. These different types of vaccines are being developed to provide comprehensive protection against malaria.</p></p>
