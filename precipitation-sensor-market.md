<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Precipitation Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tipping Bucket Precipitation Sensor</li><li>Weighing Precipitation Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tipping Bucket Precipitation Sensor is a type of sensor that consists of a funnel that collects rain or snow, which is then funneled into a small bucket that tips when a specific amount of precipitation is reached. Weighing Precipitation Sensor, on the other hand, measures the weight of the collected precipitation to determine the amount of rainfall or snowfall. Both types of sensors are commonly used in weather stations and hydrological applications to monitor and track precipitation levels accurately.</p></p>
