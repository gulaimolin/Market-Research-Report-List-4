<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Field-effect Transistor (OFET) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N type transistor</li><li>P type transistor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Organic Field-effect Transistor (OFET) market can be classified into two main types: N type transistors and P type transistors. N type transistors are characterized by the presence of electron-donating materials in organic semiconductors, leading to a surplus of electrons that conduct electricity. On the other hand, P type transistors have electron-withdrawing materials in organic semiconductors, resulting in a lack of electrons and the conduction of holes. Both types of transistors play a crucial role in the development of organic electronics and offer unique advantages in various applications.</p></p>
