<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Apple Cider Vinegar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filtered</li><li>Unfiltered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Organic apple cider vinegar is available in two main types: filtered and unfiltered. Filtered apple cider vinegar has been processed to remove any sediment and impurities, resulting in a clear liquid. Unfiltered apple cider vinegar, on the other hand, retains the "mother" culture, which contains beneficial enzymes and bacteria. This gives it a cloudy appearance and a stronger flavor. Both types offer similar health benefits, but some people prefer unfiltered apple cider vinegar for its potential additional nutritional value.</p></p>
