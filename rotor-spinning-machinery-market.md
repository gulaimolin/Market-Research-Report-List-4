<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotor Spinning Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-venting Type</li><li>Pumping Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotor spinning machinery market offers two main types based on the spinning process: self-venting type and pumping type. The self-venting type eliminates the need for additional equipment as it depends on the spinning process alone to create the necessary airflow. On the other hand, the pumping type requires a separate air supply system to pump air into the spinning rotor. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different spinning requirements in the textile industry.</p></p>
