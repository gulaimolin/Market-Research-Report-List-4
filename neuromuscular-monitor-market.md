<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuromuscular Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EMG Type Neuromuscular Monitor</li><li>MMG Type Neuromuscular Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neuromuscular monitors are devices used to assess the function of muscles and nerves in the body. There are two main types of neuromuscular monitors: EMG (electromyography) monitors and MMG (mechanomyography) monitors. EMG monitors measure the electrical activity of muscles, providing information on muscle function and nerve conduction. MMG monitors, on the other hand, measure the mechanical activity of muscles, offering insights into muscle contractions and overall muscle function. Both types of monitors play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring neuromuscular disorders.</p></p>
