<p><h1>Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market Size Focuses on Market Dynamics, In-Depth Analysis and Future Projections of its Market Forecasted for Period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable scaffolds are medical devices that are used in vascular interventions such as coronary artery disease. These scaffolds are designed to provide support to the blood vessels during the healing process, and then gradually dissolve or get absorbed by the body over time without leaving any permanent implant behind. This innovative technology has gained popularity in recent years due to its potential advantages over traditional metallic stents, including reduced risk of late thrombosis and allowing the vessel to return to its normal physiological state.</p><p>The Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.8% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising demand for minimally invasive procedures, and technological advancements in the field of bioresorbable scaffolds. Additionally, the growing geriatric population and higher adoption rates of these devices in emerging economies are also driving the market growth. Latest trends in the Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market include the development of next-generation scaffolds with improved mechanical properties and the integration of drug-eluting capabilities to prevent restenosis. Manufacturers are also focusing on enhancing the delivery systems and increasing the availability of these devices in various sizes to cater to different patient populations.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Scaffolds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal-based Bioresorbable Scaffold</li><li>Polymer-based Bioresorbable Scaffold</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable scaffolds are used in cardiovascular procedures to support blood vessels and then gradually dissolve in the body over time. Metal-based bioresorbable scaffolds are made from materials like magnesium or iron, providing strength and structure before being absorbed. Polymer-based bioresorbable scaffolds are made from biodegradable polymers like polylactic acid, offering flexibility and versatility. Both types of scaffolds aim to provide temporary support and then be naturally absorbed by the body, reducing long-term complications compared to permanent implants.</p></p>
